# Commit, Push, and Create PR

This command automates the workflow of committing changes, pushing to remote, and creating a pull request.

## Usage
Use this command when you've completed a feature or fix and want to create a PR in one shot.

## Instructions

You are about to commit changes, push to remote, and create a pull request. Follow these steps:

1. **Check Current Status**
   - Run `git status` to see what files have changed
   - Run `git branch` to confirm current branch name
   - Run `git diff` to review all changes

2. **Analyze Changes**
   - Review all modified files
   - Understand the scope of changes
   - Determine if this is a feature, fix, refactor, etc.

3. **Commit Changes**
   - Stage all relevant files with `git add`
   - Create a clear, concise commit message that:
     - Summarizes the "why" not just the "what"
     - Follows the repository's commit message style (check recent `git log`)
     - Is 1-2 sentences maximum
   - Include co-author: `Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`
   - Use heredoc format for the commit message

4. **Push to Remote**
   - Check if branch is tracking remote with `git branch -vv`
   - If not tracking, push with `-u` flag: `git push -u origin <branch-name>`
   - If already tracking, use: `git push`

5. **Create Pull Request**
   - Use `gh pr create` command
   - Title should be clear and descriptive
   - Body should include:
     - **Summary**: 1-3 bullet points of what changed
     - **Test plan**: Checklist of how to test/verify the changes
     - Footer: `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)`
   - Use heredoc for PR body to ensure proper formatting
