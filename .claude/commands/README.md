# Commands Directory

This directory contains **user-invoked workflows** that orchestrate agents and automate common development tasks. Commands are triggered using `/command-name` syntax.

---

## What Are Commands?

Commands are markdown files that define:
- 🚀 **Workflows**: Multi-step automated processes
- 🔧 **Orchestration**: Coordination of multiple agents
- ⚡ **Shortcuts**: Quick access to common operations

Commands differ from agents:
- **Agents** = Specialized workers with domain expertise
- **Commands** = Workflow orchestrators that coordinate agents

## How Commands Work

### Invocation

Commands are triggered with `/command-name`:
```
/full-feature add user notifications
/quick-fix login button not responding
/lint-fix
```

### With Arguments

Some commands accept arguments:
```
/new-component UserAvatar          # Component name
/create-migration "add index"      # Description in quotes
/spike evaluate caching options    # Research topic
```

### Command vs Agent Decision

| Need | Use |
|------|-----|
| Complete workflow (plan → implement → test → PR) | **Command** (`/full-feature`) |
| Specific expertise (security audit) | **Command** (`/security-review`) |
| One-off specialized task | **Agent** (direct delegation) |
| Simple code change | Neither (do it directly) |

---

## Usage

\`\`\`
/command-name <arguments>
\`\`\`

---

## What This Command Does

Numbered list of steps...

---

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Name
Details...

### Step 2: Name
Details...

---

## Success Criteria

- Criterion 1
- Criterion 2

---

## Related

- Related command
- Related agent
```

### Best Practices

1. **Clear purpose**: One-line description of what it does
2. **Usage examples**: Show common invocations
3. **Defined steps**: Clear workflow with phases
4. **Success criteria**: How to know it completed successfully
5. **Duration estimate**: Help users plan their time

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not recognized"
- Check spelling of command name
- Ensure command file exists in `.claude/commands/`
- Verify file is valid markdown

### "Command failed partway through"
- Check error messages in output
- Verify prerequisites are met
- Try running failed step manually

### "Command taking too long"
- Some commands (like `/full-feature`) are designed for long tasks
- Check progress updates for status
- Can interrupt and resume later
