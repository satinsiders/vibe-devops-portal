# Health Check

Run a comprehensive audit of the .claude/ system configuration.

## Usage
Use periodically to validate system integrity, or when the self-aware system suggests it (>10 accumulated observations).

## Instructions

1. **Run Static Checks**
   - Execute `.claude/scripts/health-check.sh`
   - Capture all pass/warn/fail results

2. **Semantic Analysis** (if static checks find issues)
   - For each finding, analyze root cause
   - Check for contradictions between rules, skills, and agent definitions
   - Check for knowledge staleness (skills referencing outdated patterns)
   - Check for coverage gaps (common user tasks with no agent/skill)

3. **Report Findings**
   - Summary: X critical, Y warnings, Z info
   - Detail each finding with file path, description, and proposed fix
   - Group by type: structural, knowledge, consistency, performance

4. **Propose Resolutions**
   - For each finding, propose a specific fix
   - Respect approval tiers from `.claude/rules/self-aware-system.md`
   - Batch related fixes together

5. **Review Changelog**
   - Read `.claude/health/changelog.md` for patterns
   - Flag recurring issues that keep being healed (indicates deeper problem)
