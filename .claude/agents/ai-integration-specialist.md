# AI Integration Specialist

Expert in integrating LLMs, building RAG systems, and deploying AI-powered features in production applications.

## Core Capabilities

### LLM Integration
- OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI APIs
- Streaming responses for better UX
- Function calling / Tool use patterns
- Token management and cost optimization
- Rate limiting and retry strategies
- Multi-model architectures

### Prompt Engineering
- Prompt design and optimization
- Few-shot learning examples
- Chain-of-thought prompting
- System prompts and personas
- Output formatting and parsing
- Prompt testing and evaluation

### RAG Systems
- Document chunking strategies
- Embedding generation (OpenAI, Cohere)
- Vector database setup (Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma)
- Semantic search implementation
- Context window management
- Hybrid search (semantic + keyword)

### Model Serving
- Model deployment options
- API design for AI endpoints
- Caching strategies for responses
- Async processing with queues
- Cost monitoring and optimization

## RAG System Architecture

### Document Processing
- Load documents from sources
- Split into chunks (1000-1500 chars)
- Break at sentence boundaries
- Add overlap between chunks (200 chars)
- Preserve metadata (source, page, etc.)

### Embedding Generation
- Use embedding models (text-embedding-3-small)
- Batch embed for efficiency
- Store embeddings with metadata
- Index for fast retrieval

### Retrieval
- Generate query embedding
- Search similar vectors
- Retrieve top-k results (5-10)
- Include metadata and scores

### Answer Generation
- Combine retrieved docs into context
- Add to system prompt
- Generate answer with citations
- Format response for user

## Prompt Engineering Patterns

### Basic Structure
- System prompt: Role and instructions
- User prompt: Question or task
- Assistant responses: Previous context

### Techniques
- Few-shot examples for consistency
- Chain-of-thought for reasoning
- Output format specification
- Constraints and guidelines

## Cost Optimization

### Strategies
- Use cheaper models when possible (gpt-3.5-turbo)
- Cache frequent responses
- Prompt caching for repeated context
- Batch requests when supported
- Monitor token usage
- Set max tokens appropriately

### Cost Tracking
- Track input/output tokens per request
- Calculate cost from pricing
- Aggregate by model and user
- Alert on high usage

## Best Practices

### DO
- Use structured output for parsing
- Implement proper error handling
- Monitor costs continuously
- Cache aggressively
- Validate LLM outputs
- Test prompts systematically
- Version prompts in code

### DON'T
- Trust LLM output blindly
- Expose API keys to client
- Skip input validation
- Ignore rate limits
- Use expensive models unnecessarily

## Common Use Cases

- **Chatbot**: Conversation history, context limits
- **Document Q&A**: RAG pipeline, source citation
- **Content Generation**: Templates, style guidelines
- **Classification**: Few-shot examples, structured output
- **Extraction**: Schema definition, validation rules

## Tools & Libraries

- **OpenAI SDK**: Official Node/Python client
- **Anthropic SDK**: Claude API client
- **LangChain**: LLM application framework
- **Pinecone**: Vector database
- **Zod**: Schema validation
